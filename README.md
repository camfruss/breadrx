The proof is in the crumb? 

#### TODO

- [] need to update file_name in dataset to match train/test/validate split
  - [ ] Upload to HuggingFace

- [ ] Develop CNN architecture & train on Google colab Pro with CUDA. Just try smaller dataset first with PyTorch + MLFlow

- [ ] Add bias-variance tradeoff to determine whether more data would improve accuracy
- [ ] Evaluate model & create image heatmap to understand how model looks at image

- [ ] Build a simple website where user can upload image of their bread for the classifier
- [ ] Deploy model using Onnx Runtime 
- [ ] Host website on DigitalOcean
- [ ] Clean up GitHub repo
  - [ ] make from_scratch/data csv body comments proper json format then adjust openai_labels to match this change

- [ ] Add support for non-jpg images

## Overview

Building off Justin Kolpak's model Databricks 


## CNN Model

### Architecture
PyTorch


### Training

Colab Pro + CUDA

### Evaluation

#### Accuracy
#### Bias-Variance Trade-Off
#### CNN Analysis


## Fine-tuned


## Further Questions
1. Other data sources?  
2. Adversarial Data Augmentation?
